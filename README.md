# Dev Edmonton Mentoring
Dev Edmonton Mentorin is the place to ask questions that involve more then a Stack Overlow answer.  Questions that require some discussion.  Answers that include the why as well as the what.  Questions answered by local developers who you likely have, or will, meeting person at one of the many local Edmonton Meetups.

You can ask your question during the Mentorship Call.  Just attend the call and wait until the mondirator prompts you.  We do our best to get every questions answered but of course we can't gurentee it.

It is much appreaciated if you post your question in advance as an [issue](https://github.com/devedmonton/mentoring/issues).  This gives the mentor time to prepare a detailed answer.
